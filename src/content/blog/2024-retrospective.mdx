## How it started

The very end of 2023 was an earth-shattering moment for me. It was December 16, 2023 that I learned that my wife of two years ‚Äì partner of six ‚Äì was having an affair. In an instant my world came crumbling down; that feeling followed me into 2024 where I wondered where life would take me now.

I felt lost, insecure, and was questioning everything. What was I going to do? How could I ever move on? Where do I go?

I didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) have the money to move into an apartment by myself on Long Island where a studio apartment goes for $2,000.00/month which is just over 50% of my monthly take-home income.

I didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) have a remote job, so while friend‚Äôs graciously offered me rooms in their homes outside Albany, NY and Houston, TX, that wasn‚Äôt an option either.

So, I went to my parents and asked if I could move back in knowing full well there was not a room available in the house. Thankfully, they agreed to rent a storage unit to store their stuff in so I could claim a 120 sq. ft. bedroom for myself. Note, the storage unit is larger than my bedroom üòÇ

That‚Äôs a bleak onset of the year, but that‚Äôs life. I don‚Äôt tell you all of this so for your pity, but so you can see the massive turnaround one event had on me; that event was my first tech conference.

## Entering the tech community

Some quick background: I have been studying web development on and off for several years. I started in late 2018/early 2019 and wandered from frontend web development ‚Äî&gt; IT Helpdesk work ‚Äî&gt; cloud engineering ‚Äî&gt; frontend web development/engineering ‚ôªÔ∏è. Through the years my discipline would come and go like waves upon a shore. While I joined Twitter (now X) in April 2018, I was not very active and more of a lurker.

However, in 2023 I won a ticket to attend THAT Conference in Round Rock, TX (outside Austin) which was from January 29, 2024 - January 31. Little did I know how impactful that one event would be.

I‚Äôve written about [THAT Conference](https://ryanfurrer.com/blog/that-conference/) on my blog before, and [The Power of Community](https://ryanfurrer.beehiiv.com/p/the-power-of-community) on my newsletter, but here is the number one thing THAT Conference did for me:

**It gave me a place where I felt like I _belonged_ once again. I hadn‚Äôt felt that since I was in the music education and performance community prior to 2018.**

The people I met at THAT quickly became friends that I now cannot imagine my life without! Not only that but I truly believe that it is only because of these connections I was afforded and was able to succeed in the other opportunities I‚Äôve had this year, including but not limited to:

- Working with [James Q. Quick](https://www.jamesqquick.com/) on [Deals for Devs](https://www.dealsfordevs.com/)
- Working with [Shashi Lo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashilo/) on [Gridiron Survivor](https://www.gridironsurvivor.com/login)
- Taking part in the [Dallas Software Developers](https://www.dallassoftwaredevelopers.org/) [cohort](https://www.dallassoftwaredevelopers.org/cohorts) led by [Danny Thompson](https://www.dthompsondev.com/)
- Starting my [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ryandotfurrer)
- Starting my podcast, [Web Dev Dialogues](https://www.webdevdialogues.com/)

All that to boot, I firmly believe my first job in tech will stem from the connections I have made and continue to make in the community.

Thank you to everyone that has shown me nothing but kindness, support, friendship, and more through this year. I would not have gotten through this year as well as I did without you all.

## Leaning into _me_

Over the last 5 - 6 years I‚Äôve started being more comfortable with _who I am_. That‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôve settled and do not want to continue to improve, but instead of trying to be a version of myself others seem to want me to be I am leaning into being the version of myself _I want to be_.

**In 2024 I leaned even more into this.**

This might be obvious to some but for me it‚Äôs only come to light in recent years how much effort I was putting in to be a version of myself to appease others rather than myself. Through self-care including therapy, journaling, and meditation I am finally happy with _some_ of the things I am doing and am celebrating all wins no matter the size . There is of course, room for improvement; for example, my physical health is in rough shape and has been an ongoing struggle for years but that is entirely in my control.

## Worrying about only what you can control

This is an extension of my self-development, but I have really tried my hardest to only worry about only what I can directly control.

For example, a major push I made this year is making the effort to lift others up. I have been a negative person for many years ‚Äì living with my parents again makes me see where I got it ‚Äì and this year I wanted to change that. Guess what? That is something I am in direct control of.

While you cannot control everything, there is always something you can control in any situation. I cannot control the fact that my ex-wife had an affair; what I _can_ control is how I let it affect me. I can feel the anxiety and emotions, however, I can instead put that energy into what I can do to bounce back from it.

> ‚ÄúRemember: You don‚Äôt control what happens, you control how you respond.‚Äù - Ryan Holiday

## Being selfish

Being selfish was alwas surrounded with a negative connotation in my life, however, I truly believe that if you are not putting yourself first you are doing yourself a disservice.

There are, of course, circumstances where you cannot; caring for a sick loved one, caring for a newborn, etc. But you cannot assume anyone else will put you first, so you ought to ensure you _do it for you_.

This is something I‚Äôve really been trying to do and havce both succeeded and failed this year. There are a few friends who know I bit off more than I could chew at times as I did not say ‚Äúno‚Äù enough this year. These are all lessons I am continuing to learn and boundaries I am learning to set.

## How it ended

I‚Äôm closing out this year with my head held high and excited for 2025. In an almost poetic manner, I attended another tech conference in the beginning of December; the Commit Your Code Conference (CYC Conference) which took place in Plano, TX (outside of Dallas).

These conferences that book-ended my year were very similar in vibes but very different in personal execution.

I went into THAT Conference knowing about 3 - 5 people in the community. I went into the CYC Conference knowing _hundreds_.

I went into THAT Conference feeling alone. I went into the CYC Conference feeling more connected than ever.

However, I came out of both feeling energized, excited, and thankful.

At the CYC Conference I had the opportunity to meet legends such as Leon and Quincy Larson, as well as my Dallas Software Developers cohort lead, Yoon! I had people coming up to _me_ recognizing _who I was_ from the community. It was a humbling experience to say the least and I am so thankful to the team that pulled it off: Danny Thompson, Braydon Coyer, Devyn Coyer, Dennis Garcia, and Erik Anderson.

I don‚Äôt say this all to brag, but to point out how one catalyst turned a year I wanted to forget into a year I could _never_ forget.
