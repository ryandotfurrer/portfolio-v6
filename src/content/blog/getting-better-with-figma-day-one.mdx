description: "Figma is a powerful design tool that allows designers to create, collaborate, and share designs in real-time. The fact is that it's an industry standard, and with me being part designer/part engineer, I think it's time I get more comfortable with it."

Day One was me reacquainting myself with Figma. I started by reviewing the basics of the interface and exploring the various tools and features available. I also took some time to familiarize myself with the keyboard shortcuts and the different ways to navigate the canvas. [Juxtopposed video](https://youtu.be/1pW_sk-2y40?si=p1KnTPOMLtOo_M6m) on this was super helpful and is what kicked off this idea!

Who doesn't like [cards]() on websites. They come in all sorts of... well not shapes but sizes and designs. I've seen truly beautiful ones and wanted to get better with playing with multiple layers.

I knew I wanted a simple card consisting of a header, small paragraph, an icon, and a gradient. I often see cards come in threes and when I'm playing with colors in counts of three it's very difficult for me to _not_ think of Pokèmon, so I just went with it!

There are actually several layers to each card:

1. A circle with it's midpoint roughly anchored to the card's bottom right corner.
2. A recangle above it acting as a mask for the circle and bringing in the darker emerald/blue/rose colors.
3. A rectangle of the same size above that with a semi-opaque and lighter emerald/blue/rose color with an inner-shadow of the darker color.
4. The text and icon are the final layers.

Even the button has a semi-transparent background which allows the main color to bleed through, as well as a semi-transparent border.

These are simple but I like them!

There is no goal to do one per day, but I’d like to do at least four three week so I can see progress. I also plan to write a short blog (or [micro-blog](/tags/micro-blog), if you will) about each design I create or copy. If you’re in a similar boat, I encourage you to jump on board and do the same!

I’ll be sharing my progress on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/ryandotfurrer) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanfurrer/). If you’re interested in following along, feel free to follow me on those platforms!
