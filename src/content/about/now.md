## Learning

I'm dedicating time to understanding the intricacies of modern web development. This includes exploring advanced JavaScript concepts, mastering new frameworks like Astro and Solid.js, and staying updated with the latest trends in the industry. I'm also delving into backend technologies such as serverless functions and databases to become a more well-rounded developer.

## Building

I'm actively developing several personal projects to solidify my understanding and showcase my skills. These projects range from small utilities to more complex web applications. The goal is to apply what I'm learning in a practical setting, experiment with different architectures, and create tangible examples of my abilities for my portfolio.

## Sharing

I believe in the power of knowledge sharing and am committed to documenting my learning journey. I regularly publish blog posts and tutorials on topics I'm exploring, aiming to help other developers who may be facing similar challenges. This also helps me reinforce my own understanding and contribute back to the developer community.

## Networking

I'm actively seeking opportunities to connect with fellow developers and designers. I attend online meetups, participate in forums, and engage in discussions on social media. I'm always eager to collaborate on projects, exchange ideas, and learn from the experiences of others in the field.

I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges, so feel free to reach out if you have something interesting in mind!
