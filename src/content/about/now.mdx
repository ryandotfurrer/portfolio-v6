import WorkStatus from '~/components/react/WorkStatus.tsx';

<WorkStatus status="available" className="no-underline" client:load />

I am currently working part-time at a consulting agency called <a href='https://ziva-tech.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ziva Tech</a> where I am a Frontend Engineer — though my main job there is "making things pretty" as per the owner. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS with a React Native project on the horizon.

This is my first job in the industry and I am thrilled to have landed it, however, it certainly comes with it's learning curves on both ends — mainly around communication. That said, I'll continue to do my best while looking for a full-time role!

I have several side projects in the works, built with Astro or Next.js. Some of those projects include: a task app, a read-later app, and an eRacing League Management.

I've also begun working through some <a href='https://leetcode.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Leetcode</a> problems as well as the <a href='https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Harvard CS50</a> course to help solidify my understanding of computer science concepts.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and catching up on shows and movies that friends have been telling me about forever (sorry everyone). For tracking media I want to watch, read, or play, I use <a href='https://www.getsequel.app/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Sequel</a> and _highly_ recommend it.

## 🎮 Video Games

For video games I just beat <a href='https://seaofstarsgame.co/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Sea of Stars</a> and give it a 9.5/10 — the art, music, and story are all fantastic, but the combat can get a bit repetitive. Now I can finally move onto the <a href='https://ffvii-remake-intergrade.square-enix-games.com/en-us/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>!

## 📚 Books

I'm in the middle of reading a couple of books: <a href='https://www.engguidebook.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>The Software Engineer's Guidebook</a> and <a href='https://calnewport.com/slow/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Slow Productivity</a>.

## 🎬 Shows & Movies

And lastly I just finished watching a few shows: <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21209876/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Solo Leveling</a>, <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28093628/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Common Side Effects</a>, and <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6741278/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Invincible</a>. Next up I'm watching <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Death Note</a> and <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Silicon Valley</a>.

## 🗓️ Upcoming Events

Finally, I have a few trips planned this year:

- **June**: I'll be attending <a href='https://www.renderatl.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>RenderATL</a> in Atlanta, GA!
- **September**: I'll be attending <a href='https://www.commityourcode.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>The Commit Your Code Conference</a> in Plano, TX!
- **October**: I'll be attending the <a href='https://www.roadatlanta.com/motul-petit-le-mans' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Petite Le Mans</a> at Road Atlanta in Braselton, GA!
