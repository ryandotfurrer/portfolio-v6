## 💼 Work

I finally landed my first full-time role in the industry — I am currently working at <a href='https://pragma.gg/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Pragma</a> as a Design Engineer! I am working on <a href='https://firstlook.gg/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>FirstLook</a>, a platform for video game developers to build and manage their playtester community. It's also a place for playtesters to find new games to playtest.

As an avid video gamer, I am so happy to to be working on a project that not only aligns with me and my interets, but also helps the community. Our stack is Astro and SolidJS.

## 💻 Projects

In the ongoing effort to improve my skills, I've got a couple of side-projects in the works; **Cadence** and **Raider.IO+**.

**Cadence** aims to be a browser homepage, similar to <a href='https://momentumdash.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Momentum</a>, if you remember when that was all the rage. Cadence was inspired by <a href='https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1930022190453535205' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this post</a> on X/Twitter and I knew that I just had to create it once I saw it. It's very much a WIP (work-in-progress) but I look forward to getting the MVP complete after RenderATL so I can start using it.

**Raider.IO+** is a project that aims to be a lighter, faster, and more minimal version of <a href='https://raider.io/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Raider.IO</a>. It is also a WIP (work-in-progress) but since Raider.IO provides their API for free, all I have to do is ensure I'm getting the information I want and decide how to display it.

Raider.IO is a service for World of Warcraft players to showcase and track their performance in various in-game events, like dungeons and raids. However, their site is slow, riddled with ads, and could use some sprucing up, in my opinion.

## 🎮 Video Games

I've been finding it hard to sit down and play one game at a time, so I find myself boucning between a handful.

**So far this year I've completed**: Sea of Stars.

**Currently I am playing**: Final Fantasy VII Remake, Project Epoch (World of Warcraft private server), Octopath Traveler I, Triangle Strategy, and various Pokémon games.

## 📚 Books

I've _definitely_ not been reading nearly as much I'd like to be. I have a goal to change that for the last bit of 2025.

**So far this year I've read**: Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done by Jon Acuff.

**Currently reading**: So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport.

**Up next**: No idea yet 🤔

## 🎬 Shows & Movies

Since my last update I've been watching mostly anime since I've not watched it for many years and a ton of friends are always recommending new shows. 

**So far this year I've watched**: Invincible, Common Side Effects, Solo Leveling, MF Ghost, OVERTAKE!, Freiren: Beyond Journey's End, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation, The Beginning After the End, The Eminence in Shadow, The Apothecary Diaries, Steins;Gate, Kaiju No. 8, and Jujutsu Kaisen.

**Currently watching**: WitchWatch

**Ongoing**: Formula 1

**Up next**: Chainsaw Man

## 🗓️ Upcoming Events

Due to the recent acquisition of my job, I am putting off attending any events for the rest of the year so I can focus on my new role. While I am upset about missing out on some great events and seeing my friends, I am excited and honored to have this amazing opportunity and need to ensure I give it my all.
