**I will be at RenderATL from Tuesday, June 10 - Saturday, June 14 — be sure to
say hello!**

## 💼 Work

I am currently working part-time at a consulting agency called <a href='https://ziva-tech.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ziva Tech</a> where I am a Frontend Engineer — though my main job there is "making things pretty" as per the owner. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS with a React Native project on the horizon.

That said, I am very much looking for a full-time position where I can continue to grow my skills and contribute to a team that values collaboration and innovation. If you or anyone you know is hiring please <a href='/contact'>contact me</a>!

## 💻 Projects

In the ongoing effort to improve my skills, I've got a couple of side-projects in the works; **Cadence** and **Raider.io+**.

**Cadence** aims to be a browser homepage, similar to <a href='https://momentumdash.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Momentum</a>, if you remember when that was all the rage. Cadence was inspired by <a href='https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1930022190453535205' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this post</a> on X/Twitter and I knew that I just had to create it once I saw it. It's very much a WIP (work-in-progress) but I look forward to getting the MVP complete after RenderATL so I can start using it.

**Raider.io+** is a project that aims to be a lighter, faster, and more minimal version of <a href='https://raider.io/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Raider.io</a>. It is also a WIP (work-in-progress) but since Raider.io provides their API for free, all I have to do is ensure I'm getting the information I want and decide how to display it.

Raider.io is a service for World of Warcraft players to showcase and track their performance in various in-game events, like dungeons and raids. However, their site is slow, riddled with ads, and could use some sprucing up, in my opinion.

## 🎮 Video Games

I've been working through the <a href='https://ffvii-remake-intergrade.square-enix-games.com/en-us/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, raiding in <a href='https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>World of Warcraft</a> twice per week, and playing the occasional matches of <a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Helldivers 2</a>, <a href='https://crabchampions.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Crab Champions</a>, and now <a href='https://www.splitgate.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Splitgate 2</a> since it released on June 6.

I've also really been enjoying some Pokemon ROM hacks like <a href='https://sphericalice.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Pokemon Gaia</a> and <a href='https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-unbound-completed.382178/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Pokemon Unbound</a>.
