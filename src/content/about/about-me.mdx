👋🏻 Hey, I’m Ryan Furrer — a Frontend Web Developer, streamer, and blogger passionate about crafting user-friendly digital experiences. From Long Island, NY, I’ve transitioned from a music career to tech, bringing creativity and problem-solving to every project.

I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NextJS, Astro, and Tailwind CSS, with a focus on UX development, accessibility, and clean design. Whether it’s building apps or sharing knowledge, I love making the web better, one line of code at a time.

Before coding, I was a musician and viola instructor—skills like discipline and adaptability still fuel my work.

Through my site, I share projects, insights on web development, and tips for career-transitioners like me. Check out my [projects](/projects), [writing](/writing), or [latest talks](/speaking).

You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/ryandotfurrer) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanfurrer/), or catch me live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ryandotfurrer).

Got a project in mind or just want to chat tech? [Reach out](/contact)!
