👋🏻 Hey, I’m Ryan Furrer — a Frontend Web Developer, streamer, and blogger passionate about crafting user-friendly digital experiences. Currently residing in Islip, NY, I've transitioned from a career in music education and performance, to buying and sub-contract administration, to tech.

I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NextJS, Astro, and Tailwind CSS, with a focus on UX development, accessibility, and clean design. Whether it’s building apps or sharing knowledge, I love making the web better, one line of code at a time.

Through my site, I share projects, insights on web development, and tips for career-transitioners like me. Check out my [projects](/projects), [writing](/writing), or [latest public appearances](/speaking) where you can see my talks, podcast appearances, and more.

You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/ryandotfurrer) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanfurrer/), or catch me live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ryandotfurrer).

Got a project in mind or just want to chat tech? [Reach out](/contact)!
