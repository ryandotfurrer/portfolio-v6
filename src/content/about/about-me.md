My journey into tech was not straightforward. I started my career in a completely different field, but I always had a passion for technology. I remember spending hours tinkering with computers as a kid, and I was always fascinated by the possibilities that technology offered.

Eventually, I decided to make a career change and pursue my passion for technology. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned the fundamentals of web development. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I quickly realized that I had found my calling.

Since then, I've been working as a web developer, and I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects. I'm always learning new things, and I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my skills.

I'm passionate about building beautiful, functional websites and applications that solve real-world problems. I'm also a strong believer in the power of open source, and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and spending time with my family. I'm also a big fan of video games and science fiction.
