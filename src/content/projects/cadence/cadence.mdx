**Cadence** aims to be a browser homepage, similar to <a href='https://momentumdash.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Momentum</a>, if you remember when that was all the rage. Cadence was inspired by <a href='https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1930022190453535205' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this post</a> on X/Twitter and I knew that I just had to create it once I saw it. It's very much a WIP (work-in-progress) but I look forward to getting the MVP complete after RenderATL so I can start using it.
