**Raider.IO+** is a project that aims to be a lighter, faster, and more minimal version of <a href='https://raider.io/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Raider.IO</a>. It is also a WIP (work-in-progress) but since Raider.IO provides their API for free, all I have to do is ensure I'm getting the information I want and decide how to display it.

Raider.IO is a service for World of Warcraft players to showcase and track their performance in various in-game events, like dungeons and raids. However, their site is slow, riddled with ads, and could use some sprucing up, in my opinion.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 *:rounded-lg *:border *:shadow-sm md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-4">
