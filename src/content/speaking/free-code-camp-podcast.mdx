## How it happened

I was absolutely thrilled when I was invited to speak on the Free Code Camp Podcast hosted by Quincy Larson. I've been a huge fan of his work for years, and to be able to speak with him was a dream come true.

Quincy put out a <a href='https://x.com/ossia/status/1904584521229705433' target='_blank' noopener noreferrer>post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> asking if anyone would be interested in being on the podcast and I jumped at the opportunity to say "Yes please!" Before I knew it, Quincy had sent me a message on X and we were set up for a recording.

More people than I could've imagined have reached out to me to say thank you for sharing my story and for the advice I shared in the podcast — I'm just happy I could give back to the community that helped me so much.
