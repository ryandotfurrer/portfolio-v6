title: 'Creating an Essential Design System'
description: "I was lucky enough to be invited to speak at the Vercel NYC meetup, however, I only had a couple of days to prepare. Thankfully, Vercel's Geist is a great source of inspiration and I was able to put together a talk about creating an essential design system."
