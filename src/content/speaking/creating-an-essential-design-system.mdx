## My first in-person talk

Giving my <a href='/speaking/why-not-astro/'>first talk</a> was a goal for 2025 — giving my second within two months was a bit of a surprise!

I'll be forever greateful that the community speaker for the Vercel NYC Meetup had to drop out, and that I was able to step in last minute. I said yes before I even had someting ready! However, I knew I couldn't say now, especially when <a href='https://x.com/kapehe_ok' target='\_blank' noopener nore>Kap</a> was kind enough to invite me.

I had a blast giving this talk and am looking forward to expanding on it and giving it again. You can watch the video below or <a href='https://dub.sh/rdf-design-system' target='\_blank' noopener noreferrer>check out the written version and slides</a>.
