## A love letter to Astro

I've been a big fan of <a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank' noopener noreferrer>Astro</a> for a while now, and I've been using it for a lot of my projects. I've learned a lot about the framework and I wanted to share my love for it with the community.

While I was attending the <a href='https://commityourcode.com/' target='_blank' noopener noreferrer>Commit Your Code (CYC) conference</a> in 2024, I was asked (voluntold) to give a talk about Astro by <a href='https://x.com/ladyleet' target='_blank' noopener noreferrer>Tracy Lee</a>, CEO of This Dot Labs. I was happy to oblige and I think it went well!
